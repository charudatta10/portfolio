                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>
                        I am Charudatta Gurudas Korde — an engineer, developer,
                        researcher, and educator driven by curiosity and depth.
                        I think in systems. I build with intention. I research
                        with discipline. And I teach to simplify complexity. My
                        work lives at the intersection of architecture and
                        abstraction — where ideas become structured systems and
                        theory becomes implementation. I am drawn to
                        decentralized technologies, open knowledge, and
                        designing solutions that are minimal yet comprehensive.
                        Beyond engineering, I am a lifelong learner. I enjoy
                        binge-watching anime, exploring good food, gardening,
                        reading, and coding not just as a profession but as a
                        creative outlet. I value rest and reflection as much as
                        productivity. I am also spiritual at heart. I believe
                        technology should not only advance capability but also
                        elevate awareness. For me, growth is holistic —
                        intellectual, creative, and inner. Currently, I am
                        exploring new creative dimensions — gaming, photography,
                        cartooning, and storytelling — expanding not just as a
                        technologist, but as a creator. I build systems with
                        logic, explore ideas with curiosity, and live with
                        awareness.
